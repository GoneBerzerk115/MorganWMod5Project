<dt>Size</dt>
  <dd>Basenjis are a medium sized breed that gets to about 17 inches tall from the shoulder. They also are pretty naturally thin dogs, so you won't need to worry about that factor when finding things such as a kennel or toys for them.</dd>
<dt>Energy Levels</dt>
<dd>Basenjis are very high energy dogs that require a lot of ways to burn their energy in order to keep them from creating chaos. They are incredibly fun to play with and could go for hours. They are have a very high prey drive, so things like lures, balls, or even some cat toys will keep them entertained for hours, and as we all know, a tired dog is a happy one!</dd>
<dt>Hygiene</dt>
<dd>Basenjis are sometimes considered to be the cats of the dog breed because of things like their high prey drive, ocasional anti socialness, and their cleaning habits. Basenjis will self clean thouroughly, so you don't need to bath them too often, about once a week will be fine! They also have short hair that doesn't shed much at all, so you don't have to worry about having a jungle of hair collecting throughout your house. Their hair doesn't grow very quickly either, so you won't need to take them to the groomers as much as other dogs.</dd>
