<dt>Origin</dt>
  <dd>The Basenji is considered to be one of the ealiest known dog species originating in Africa. They were breed to be used during hunting to lure prey into the hunter's nets. This trait can even be seen today with their prey drive. They will go after smaller animals and even attack them if they get a hold of them.</dd>
<dt>Lovability</dt>
<dd>Basenjis are a very loyal and loving breed. Though they do like to do their own thing sometimes, they are still very open to recieving loves and snugging up to their owners. If you're sitting on the couch watching some TV, they will gladly hop up and take a nap between your legs or under your planket with you!</dd>
<dt>Size</dt>
<dd>Basenjis are a medium sized dog breen that is as tall as they are long from their shoulders. This allows them to be very nimble and fast, but with that comes their high energy levels. They aren't big dogs, but they can cause havoc if their energy needs are not properly taken care of. They are perfect size for snuggles and you can carry them very easily, whether they are a puppy, or a fully grown adult.</dd>
